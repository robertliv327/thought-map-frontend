# lab4

For this lab, I made a "Thought Map" where a user can upload content and drag and drop it on the map. I'm pretty proud of the output and like how it is not just a blog. Everything went pretty smoothly with the lab, but adding in authentification was definitely a bit tricky.

Extra credit: making it a drag and drop map interface instead of a blog.
