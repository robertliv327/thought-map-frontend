# Thought Map Frontend

[Check out the app here](http://rlivaudais-cs52-blog.surge.sh)

- This app is designed so that users can drag and drop "pins" (thoughts, memories, or just images) on a world map.
- Pin creation is easy - just add a title, image, content, and tags. 
- Once the pin has been added, you can drag and drop the pin anywhere on the map.
- Clicking a pin expands the pin's contents and allows the user to edit or delete the pin.
- Users sign up with a username, email, and password.
