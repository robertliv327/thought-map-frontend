# lab4

For this lab, I created somewhat of a Gif board where you can create, update, and delete posts.

I wanted to make an app where the background image is a world map and you can create little nodes and drag them around, placing them where you want on the map. I got decently far into this before realizing that I would need to store x and y on the server so that it wouldn't reset on refresh... and the server can't handle this because it only supports a few fields. That was a bummer, so I just shifted towards animal gifs. Other than that, everything went decently smoothly with Redux.

I did not attempt any extra credit other than trying to make it a bit different than a conventional blog.
